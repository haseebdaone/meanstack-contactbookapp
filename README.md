# MyContacts

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

Just a simple project playing with the same technologies I used in my previous one but this time I implemented Angular 2 instead of ejs.
So now I'm using MongoDB, Express, Angular 2 and Nodejs, which is a full MEAN stack for the first time.

This project is simply a little contact book which I'm pretending to contain contact info of powerfull people and simply performs CRUD operations where the data is saved to Mongolabs so that you have data persistance.

## Setup

"npm install" the pakage.json and then run "ng build" (also make sure you have angular cli installed globaly) this will creates the /dist which contains the index.html that the server will serve.
From here you can run "node server" to startup the server.
