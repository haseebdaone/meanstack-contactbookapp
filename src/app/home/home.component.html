      <h4>US warns Kim Jong-Un after North Korea missile test: 'Time for talk is over'</h4>
      <p>The North Korea missile crisis deepened today as America’s ambassador to the United Nations warned: “The time for talk is over.”
          US vice-president Mike Pence also claimed “all options are on the table” after the rogue regime’s latest test of a long-range missile allegedly capable of hitting American cities.
          Donald Trump and his senior aides are looking to China to act to restrain dictator Kim Jong-un. Nikki Haley, American ambassador to the UN, said Beijing “must decide if it is finally willing to take this vital step” of taking on North Korea.
          It follows Friday’s test-firing by Pyongyang of a second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea said it flew for 47 minutes and reached an altitude of 2,300 miles, with Kim claiming it put the whole of the US within strike range.
          After the launch the US sent two su-personic B-1B bombers over the Korean peninsula in a 10-hour show of force. They were escorted by South Korean fighter jets and performed a low pass over an air base near Seoul.</p>
